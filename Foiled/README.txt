Description:
Foiled is a local two-player dueling game in which each player is armed with nothing but a sword.
They must attempt to outwit and out-maneuver their opponent by running, jumping, and diving around 
a room. When a player succeeds at landing the killing blow he is rewarded with his opponent's soul.
A goal is then illuminated in a corner where his opponent will soon reemerge. He must then attempt 
to score the soul before his time expires, or be... foiled.

It's whichever is furthest from the position where you acquired the soul.
